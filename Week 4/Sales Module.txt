Once a quotation is confirmed, Odoo locks certain fields to prevent modifications that could affect the integrity of the sales order or invoices. 
If the quotation is confirmed, you cannot directly change the quantities of the products.

Sales Module>desired products>Update quantity at top>change lot number

Reason: Once a product is assigned a lot number in Odoo (typically in the Inventory module), that lot number is associated with the specific quant (quantity) in the system. A quant represents a specific quantity of a product in stock, and it is tied to a lot number when tracking is enabled. If that product has already been reserved, shipped, or used in any transactions (like in a sales order, delivery, or stock move), the system will lock the lot number and prevent it from being edited or changed.
Solution:
Check if the lot number has already been reserved, delivered, or used in any stock transactions. If so, you cannot change it directly.
To change the lot number, you'll need to reverse any stock movements related to that product and lot number. For example, you may need to un-assign the product or reset the stock moves.
