In Odoo, a Reordering Rule is used to automate the process of ordering products when inventory levels fall below a certain 
threshold, ensuring that stock is replenished in a timely manner. The 0, 0 reordering rule refers to the minimum and maximum 
quantity values in the reordering rule setup.

Here’s a breakdown:

Reordering Rule in Odoo:
Minimum Quantity: This is the stock level at which a new order will be triggered. When the stock reaches or falls below this 
minimum quantity, Odoo will create a procurement order (e.g., purchase order or manufacturing order) to restock the product.

Maximum Quantity: This is the ideal stock level you want to maintain. Once the procurement is done, the system will ensure 
the stock level doesn't exceed this maximum quantity.

0, 0 Reordering Rule:
Minimum Quantity = 0
Maximum Quantity = 0
When the reordering rule is set to 0, 0, it means:

No reorder actions are triggered automatically, because both the minimum and maximum stock levels are set to zero.
It effectively disables the automatic stock replenishment feature because there is no threshold defined for when the stock 
should be replenished.
Use Cases:
A 0, 0 reordering rule might be used when you don’t want automatic reordering to take place and prefer to handle stock 
manually.
It might also be used for certain products where replenishment doesn’t need to be automated or managed through standard 
reordering rules.
Summary:
0, 0 reordering rule means no automatic stock replenishment for the product.
