**Why doesn't the status change to "Ready" when I click "Check Availability" on a delivery order in the Inventory module 
when it's in the "Waiting" state?
Additionally, if the status is set to "Ready" and I change it to "Waiting" after clicking "Unreserve," why does it not 
return to "Ready" after I click "Check Availability" again?**

1. Product Stock Levels
Reason: The "Check Availability" button checks if sufficient stock is available to fulfill the delivery order. If there is 
not enough stock available in your warehouse, the system will not change the status to Ready.
Solution: Ensure that you have enough stock available in the correct warehouse or location for the product. You can check 
this by going to the Inventory module and verifying stock levels for the product. If needed, you may have to receive more 
stock (via Purchase Orders) or transfer stock to the correct location.

2. Unreserved Products Not Ready for Delivery
Reason: When you click Unreserve on a delivery order, it "unassigns" the stock that was previously allocated to the order. 
The Check Availability button will attempt to reallocate stock, but if there is no stock available in the warehouse (or in 
the correct location), the status may not change to Ready.
Solution: Ensure that there is available stock in the warehouse that can be reserved for the delivery order. If the stock is 
not available or is in a different location, you might need to move it or adjust your inventory to reflect the correct stock 
levels.

1. FIFO (First In, First Out)
Products that are received first are the first ones to be sold or used.
2. LIFO (Last In, First Out)
The most recently received products are the first ones to be sold or used.
3. CL (Continuous Loop)
A strategy where inventory is continuously rotated and managed without interruption, ensuring the flow of goods 
is always active.
4. FEFO (First Expired, First Out)
Products with the earliest expiration date are sold or used first.
5. Package-Based Removal
Inventory is removed or distributed based on pre-packaged units, rather than individual product quantities.
