Holy Trinity:-
1)Standard Price: The product is assigned a fixed cost that does not change, regardless of the actual purchase or production 
cost.

2)Average Cost (AVCO): The product cost is updated by taking the average of the costs of all units in stock, including newly 
purchased or produced units.

3)First In First Out (FIFO): The first units received or produced are the first ones to be sold or used. The cost of the oldest 
inventory is used to calculate the product cost.
