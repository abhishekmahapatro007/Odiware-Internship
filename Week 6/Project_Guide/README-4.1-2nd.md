To set up site-specific budgeting and cost tracking in Odoo, you'll need to integrate the **Project Management**, **Inventory**, and **Accounting** modules, while ensuring that each construction site is linked to a project, a warehouse, and has proper cost tracking. Here's a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to do this:

### 1. **Create a Project for Each Site in Project Management**
Odoo allows you to create projects, which can be used to track costs and progress for each site.

1. **Go to the Project module**:  
   In the Odoo interface, go to the **Project** app.

2. **Create a New Project**:  
   Click on **Create** and enter the project details:
   - **Project Name**: Name it after the construction site (e.g., "Site 1" or "Site 2").
   - **Customer** (optional): If you're managing the site for a client, you can link it to a customer.
   - **Tags** (optional): You can categorize projects if you like (e.g., "Construction").

3. **Configure Tasks (Optional)**:  
   You can add specific tasks related to each project. Tasks could include things like “Concrete Pouring,” “Steel Erection,” etc., depending on the scope of the construction project.

4. **Save** the project.

Repeat this for each construction site you need to track.

### 2. **Link Each Project to a Corresponding Warehouse in Inventory**
To track material consumption by project, you'll need to link each project to a specific warehouse that represents the construction site.

1. **Go to the Inventory module**:  
   In Odoo, open the **Inventory** app.

2. **Create a Warehouse for Each Site**:  
   - Go to **Configuration** > **Warehouses**.
   - Click on **Create**.
   - **Name the Warehouse** after the construction site (e.g., "Warehouse - Site 1").
   - **Location**: Specify the location of the warehouse (this could be a city or a specific construction site area).
   - If necessary, configure specific locations inside the warehouse for better tracking (e.g., different material storage zones).

3. **Link Warehouse to Project**:  
   - When creating or managing a project in the **Project Management** module, you can add **related warehouses** by going to the **Inventory** tab in the project form and selecting the appropriate warehouse.

### 3. **Add Materials to the Project’s Bill of Materials (BoM) or Purchase Orders**
To manage the materials consumed on each project (site), you can either use a **Bill of Materials (BoM)** for predefined materials or create **purchase orders** for materials acquired during the project.

#### Option 1: **Add Materials via Bill of Materials (BoM)**

1. **Go to the Manufacturing module**:  
   Navigate to the **Manufacturing** app.

2. **Create a Bill of Materials (BoM)** for the materials you will use on the site.
   - Go to **Configuration** > **Bills of Materials** > **Create**.
   - Select the **Product** (materials like concrete, steel, etc.) and specify the quantity required for each material.
   - You can assign the BoM to specific **Projects** via custom fields or tags, which allows you to link this directly to the site project.
   - Save the BoM.

#### Option 2: **Add Materials via Purchase Orders**

1. **Create Purchase Orders for Each Site**:  
   - Go to the **Purchases** app.
   - Click **Create** to create a new purchase order.
   - Select the **Vendor** (supplier of the materials).
   - Add the **Products** (materials) you are purchasing for the project.
   - Under the **Warehouse** field, select the **Warehouse** associated with the project (site).
   - **Project**: In the purchase order, you can link the materials to the relevant project by selecting the project under the "Project" field.
   
2. **Confirm and Receive the Materials**:  
   After confirming the purchase order, you will receive materials into the warehouse associated with the project (site), and they will be linked to the cost of the project.

### 4. **Track and Report Costs Using Odoo’s Accounting Module**
Odoo’s **Accounting** module can be used to track and report costs for each project. This allows you to monitor material costs and other expenses by site.

1. **Set Up Cost Centers (Optional)**:  
   - You can set up **Cost Centers** for each project/warehouse to track the expenses separately.
   - Go to **Accounting** > **Configuration** > **Analytic Accounts**.
   - Click **Create** and create an analytic account for each construction site (e.g., "Site 1" or "Site 2").
   
2. **Link Project to Analytic Account**:
   - In the **Project** form, link the project to the **Analytic Account** (representing the project or site).
   - This allows you to track all costs related to the project in the accounting module.
   
3. **Track Material Costs**:
   - When you receive materials via **Purchase Orders**, Odoo will automatically record the cost of these materials under the linked project’s analytic account.
   - You can view the costs of materials directly within the **Analytic Accounting** module.

4. **Generate Financial Reports**:  
   - You can generate detailed reports from the **Accounting** module by going to **Accounting** > **Reporting**.
   - Select **Analytic Reports** to see the breakdown of expenses by site.
   - You can also generate **Profit and Loss Statements** and **Balance Sheets** by selecting the relevant analytic accounts (projects).

5. **Project Cost Monitoring**:
   - Within the **Project Management** module, you can also monitor costs by looking at the project's **financial dashboard** (if you’ve linked the analytic accounts and set up proper reporting).
   - You can see how much was spent on materials, labor, and other expenses for each construction site.

### 5. **Budgeting by Site**
To manage the budget and ensure you are staying within the allocated amount for each construction site:

1. **Create a Budget**:  
   - Go to **Accounting** > **Configuration** > **Budgets**.
   - Click **Create** and enter the project (site) and the budget amount for each material or overall project cost.
   
2. **Track Budget vs. Actual**:  
   - Odoo will automatically track expenses related to each project and compare them against the budget you set. This is displayed in reports under **Budget Reports**.

---

### Summary of the Process:
1. **Create Projects for Sites** in **Project Management**.
2. **Link Projects to Warehouses** in **Inventory**.
3. **Add Materials via BoM or Purchase Orders** associated with each site.
4. **Use the Accounting module** to track and report costs by linking projects to analytic accounts, tracking expenses, and generating financial reports.
5. **Set Budgets** for each site and track progress to ensure costs are in line with the planned budget.

This integration of **Project Management**, **Inventory**, and **Accounting** helps provide detailed tracking and cost management for each construction site in Odoo.
