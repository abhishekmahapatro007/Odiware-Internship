Scope: Track inventory at the central warehouse and multiple construction sites.  
Scenario: Track material transfers from the central warehouse to a site and 
consumption during the project.  

Steps:  
1)Configure warehouses for the central store and site-specific inventories.  
-->Inventory > Configuration > Warehouses and create different warehouses and configure them according to your needs.

2)Set up stock locations within each warehouse (e.g., raw materials, tools, spare parts).  
-->Inventory > Configuration > Locations and sssign each location a name based on the type of materials you plan to store (e.g., 
--> Raw Materials, Tools, Spare Parts, etc.)
--> For each location, select the parent warehouse (Central Warehouse or any Site Warehouse).
--> Define if the location is internal, supplier (for incoming goods), or customer (for outgoing goods).

3)Test inter-site stock transfers and consumption tracking.  
--> Choose the source warehouse (e.g., Central Warehouse) and destination warehouse (e.g., Site 1 Warehouse).
--> Add the materials to be transferred. This could be cement, steel, tools, etc.
--> Confirm and validate the transfer. Once confirmed, the stock quantities will be updated in the destination warehouse.

4)Enable batch tracking for materials with expiration dates (e.g., cement bags).  
--> Enable Lot/Serial Numbers and Expiration Tracking(Make sure to check if the product is storable or not)
--> Check the Expiration date checkbox in the inventory tab of the product form and set the expiration date/best before.
