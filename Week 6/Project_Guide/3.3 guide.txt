Scope: Track inventory at the central warehouse and multiple construction sites.  
Scenario: Track material transfers from the central warehouse to a site and 
consumption during the project.  

Steps:  
Configure warehouses for the central store and site-specific inventories.  

Set up stock locations within each warehouse (e.g., raw materials, tools, spare parts).  

Test inter-site stock transfers and consumption tracking.  

Enable batch tracking for materials with expiration dates (e.g., cement bags).
