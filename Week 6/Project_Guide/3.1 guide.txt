3.1 Project Management 

Scope: Plan, track, and manage construction projects.  

Steps:  
Configure the Project module to create and track projects(e.g. highways,bridges).  
-->Head to the Apps Module and Activate the Project Module and create a new project named "Highway Construction Project" or 
anything

Define tasks, subtasks, and milestones.  
--> Create different stages(tasks)
--> Create the subtasks that should be conducted inside that particular Stage/task
--> Go to project module homepage and click the 3 buttons and create milestones from there.

Set up budgets and link them to tasks for cost tracking.  
--> You can't do this on Community version,since you need Accounting Module(Enterprise) and check the Analytic Accounting
to conduct this step.

Enable Gantt charts and timelines for visual project tracking.  
--> Refer Gaant_Chart_Demo.png for better idea.(Runbot.odoo screenshot)

Scenario: Create a sample project for constructing a highway, including tasks like site preparation, material procurement, and construction phases.
